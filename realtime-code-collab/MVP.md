# MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Specifications

## Real-Time Code Collaboration Tool MVP

### Project Overview
This MVP delivers a basic but functional real-time code collaboration tool that allows multiple users to edit code simultaneously and communicate through chat.

### Core Features

#### 1. Real-Time Code Editor
- **Monaco Editor Integration**: VS Code-like editing experience
- **Live Synchronization**: Changes appear instantly across all connected users
- **Session-Based Collaboration**: Users join sessions using session IDs
- **Language Support**: JavaScript syntax highlighting and basic features

#### 2. Session Management
- **Simple Session System**: Join/create sessions using text-based IDs
- **User Awareness**: Display connected users count and basic identifiers
- **Automatic Session Cleanup**: Empty sessions are automatically removed
- **Session State Management**: Code state persists while users are connected

#### 3. Real-Time Chat
- **Integrated Chat Panel**: Built-in messaging within each coding session
- **User Identification**: Messages show username (configurable) and timestamp
- **Session-Scoped Chat**: Chat messages are only visible to users in the same session
- **Message History**: Chat history maintained during session lifetime

#### 4. User Experience
- **Responsive Interface**: Works on desktop and tablet devices
- **Dark Theme**: Professional dark theme matching modern code editors
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicator showing connection state
- **Intuitive Layout**: Clear separation between editor, chat, and session controls

### Technical Implementation

#### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js Server**: Lightweight web server
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **In-Memory Storage**: Session and code state stored in server memory
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured for frontend integration

#### Frontend Architecture  
- **React Application**: Component-based UI
- **Monaco Editor**: Microsoft's code editor
- **Socket.IO Client**: Real-time communication
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox**: Responsive layout system

#### Infrastructure
- **Docker Support**: Complete containerization with Docker Compose
- **Development Setup**: Easy local development with npm scripts
- **Port Configuration**: Backend (5000), Frontend (3000)

### MVP User Stories

#### As a Developer, I can:
1. **Start a coding session** by opening the application
2. **Join a specific session** by entering a session ID
3. **Write and edit code** in a professional code editor
4. **See other users' changes** immediately as they type
5. **Chat with collaborators** while coding
6. **Set my username** for better identification
7. **See who else is in my session** through the user list
8. **Switch between sessions** without losing my work in other sessions

#### As a Team Lead, I can:
1. **Create a session** and share the session ID with my team
2. **Monitor who is actively collaborating** through the user list
3. **Use the chat to give guidance** and discuss code changes
4. **See all code changes in real-time** without refresh or polling

### MVP Limitations (Out of Scope)
- User authentication and persistent accounts
- File system / multiple files per session
- Code execution capabilities  
- Version control integration
- Persistent storage (database)
- Advanced editing features (IntelliSense, debugging)
- Video/voice chat
- Screen sharing
- Fine-grained permissions
- User roles and access control

### Success Metrics
1. **Functional Real-Time Sync**: Code changes appear within 100ms across clients
2. **Reliable Chat**: Messages delivered reliably to all session participants
3. **Session Stability**: Sessions remain stable with multiple concurrent users
4. **Easy Setup**: New users can join and start collaborating within 30 seconds
5. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

### Testing Scenarios

#### Basic Functionality
1. **Single User**: Can edit code and see changes reflected in editor
2. **Two Users**: Changes from one user appear in another user's editor
3. **Multiple Users**: 3+ users can collaborate simultaneously
4. **Chat System**: Messages sent by one user appear for all session participants

#### Edge Cases
1. **User Disconnection**: Remaining users continue to collaborate normally
2. **Network Interruption**: Reconnection restores sync automatically
3. **Empty Sessions**: Sessions without users are cleaned up
4. **Session Switching**: Users can move between sessions without issues

#### Performance
1. **Typing Performance**: No noticeable lag while typing
2. **Large Code Files**: Handles files up to 10,000 lines reasonably
3. **Multiple Sessions**: Server handles 10+ concurrent sessions
4. **Message Load**: Chat handles rapid message exchanges

### Deployment Requirements

#### Development Environment
- Node.js 18+
- npm 8+
- Modern web browser
- 2GB RAM minimum

#### Production Environment (Docker)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- 1GB RAM minimum
- Open ports 3000 and 5000
- Linux/MacOS/Windows support

### Future Enhancements Beyond MVP
1. **User Authentication**: Login system with persistent accounts
2. **File Management**: Support for multiple files and folders
3. **Language Support**: Additional programming languages
4. **Code Execution**: Run code within the environment
5. **Persistence**: Save sessions and code to database
6. **Advanced Editor Features**: Auto-completion, error highlighting
7. **Collaboration Tools**: Voice chat, screen sharing
8. **Project Management**: Organize sessions into projects
9. **Integration**: Git integration, third-party tool connections
10. **Analytics**: Usage tracking and collaboration insights

This MVP provides a solid foundation for real-time code collaboration while maintaining simplicity and reliability. Users can immediately start collaborating on code with minimal setup, making it perfect for quick pair programming sessions, code reviews, and team coding activities.
